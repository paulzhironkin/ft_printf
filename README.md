# Ecole 42: ft_printf

In this project I recreated basic functional of standart printf() function

Ft_printf made as part of the "libftprintf" library, which creates atfer compiling project.

### How to build:

Clone repo and promt "make":

```Bash
make
```

To clean object files:

```Bash
make clean
```

To clean object and library files:

```Bash
make fclean
```

After "make" `libftprintf.a` library file can be used in projects
