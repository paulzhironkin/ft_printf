# Ecole 42: Ft_printf project

In this project I recreated basic functional of standart printf() function

Ft_printf made as part of the "libftprintf" library, which creates atfer compiling project.

### How to use:

Clone repo and promt "make":

```Bash
make
```

```Bash
make clean
```

To clean object and library files:

```Bash

```
